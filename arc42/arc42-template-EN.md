# System Scope and Context

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system
(i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring
systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby
specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs
and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners
are among your system’s most critical aspects. Make sure that you
completely understand them.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Various options:

-   Context diagrams

-   Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

See [Context and Scope](https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/) in the arc42
documentation.

## Business Context

The following diagram provides a comprehensive view of the system's communication partners, their specific interactions, and the data exchanged with the system's environment:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/Business_Context_Diagram.png" alt="Business Context Diagram">
</p>


## Technical Context

<div class="formalpara-title">

Understanding EcoRide's technological landscape involves delving into the fundamental elements that shape our RideSharing platform. This includes the intricate interplay of technologies, infrastructure, and environments that collectively define the technical context of the App, shown in the following diagram:

<img src="images/DeploymentView.png">

**Contents**

</div>

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your
system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific
input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which
channel.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical
interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure
or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels
and input/output.

# Solution Strategy

Our Solution Strategy combines a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring scalability, reliability, and rapid development cycles

### Technology Decisions:

We are utilizing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with loosely coupled services, which enables efficient scaling of specific features in response to increased user traffic

A cloud-based infrastructure ensures system reliability, availability, and accelerated development and deployment cycles through fault isolation and redundancy

### Top-Level Decomposition:

The chosen microservices architectural pattern effectively decomposes the system into manageable, loosely coupled services, allowing for specialized functionalities and easy scaling.

### Achieving Key Quality Goals:

Scalability is achieved through SOA, enabling seamless resource allocation to handle escalating user traffic while minimizing performance impact.

The combination of SOA and a cloud-based infrastructure provides flexibility, reliability, and availability, supporting rapid development and deployment cycles, aligning with the goal of continuous integration and delivery.

# Building Block View

The Building Block View offers a structured snapshot of our system's architecture, breaking down key components and their interconnections to provide a comprehensive understanding of how EcoRide's functionalities are organized and interact

**Level 1**

This level serves as an overview of the entire system. It showcases the core components, such as FileSystemStorage, Cars, Rides, Profile and more. This level explains the interactions between these components, revealing how users access the system, how data flows between different servers or services, and how external systems communicate with the system.

![Level 1 of the Building Blocks Hierachy](images/level1-Page-1.jpg)

**Level 2**

Level 2 goes deeper into the system than Level 1. It shows more details about each part like servers, databases, and software. It explains how these parts work together, detailing specific server setups, database designs, and software functions. This level covers how data moves between different parts, and how outside systems connect. It's a closer look at how things work inside the system beyond the basic structure.

![Level 2 of the Building Blocks Hierachy](images/level2-Page-2.jpg)

**Level 3**

This level dives even deeper into the system. It gets more detailed about the CarsController mentioned in Level 2. This level shows exactly how the CarsController is set up and the external APIs

![Level 3 of the Building Blocks Hierachy](images/level3-Page-3.jpg)


## Whitebox Overall System

Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the
following white box template. It contains

-   an overview diagram

-   a motivation for the decomposition

-   black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these
    we offer you alternatives:

    -   use *one* table for a short and pragmatic overview of all
        contained building blocks and their interfaces

    -   use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks
        according to the black box template (see below). Depending on
        your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text
        files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling
        tool).

-   (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the
    black box templates of a building block, but are very important for
    understanding the white box. Since there are so many ways to specify
    interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them. In the
    worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics,
    protocols, error handling, restrictions, versions, qualities,
    necessary compatibilities and many things more. In the best case you
    will get away with examples or simple signatures.

***\<Overview Diagram>***

Motivation  
*\<text explanation>*

Contained Building Blocks  
*\<Description of contained building block (black boxes)>*

Important Interfaces  
*\<Description of important interfaces>*

Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with
name and responsibility according to the following schema:

| **Name**         | **Responsibility** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| *\<black box 1>* |  *\<Text>*         |
| *\<black box 2>* |  *\<Text>*         |

If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate
black box template for every important building block . Its headline is
the name of the black box.

### \<Name black box 1>

Here you describe \<black box 1> according the the following black box
template:

-   Purpose/Responsibility

-   Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs.
    This interfaces may include qualities and performance
    characteristics.

-   (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box,
    e.g.availability, run time behavior, ….

-   (Optional) directory/file location

-   (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to
    requirements).

-   (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

## Level 2

Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from
level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important
enough to justify such a detailed description. Please prefer relevance
over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or
volatile building blocks. Leave out normal, simple, boring or
standardized parts of your system

# Runtime View

The Runtime View provides a dynamic perspective on our system's operation, detailing the seamless interactions during the ride-booking process and real-time driver tracking. These visualizations showcase the responsive and communicative nature of EcoRide

## Runtime Scenario: Ride Booking

![Alt text](images/UML-image-1.png)

The Runtime View of the ride-booking process visually outlines interactions among three entities: the User's Device with the App, the Server, and the Driver's Device. Users initiate the process by entering their destination (Step 1), leading to the server displaying ride options (Step 2). After confirming ride details (Step 3), the server sends a request to a driver (Step 4), followed by driver acceptance (Step 5). The server communicates confirmation and estimated arrival time to the user (Step 6). Successful ride booking (Step 7) and accurate arrival time (Step 8) conclude the process, emphasizing system responsiveness and seamless communication

## Runtime Scenario: Real-Time Driver Tracking

![Alt text](images/UML-image-2.png)

The Runtime View of the Real-Time Driver Tracking captures the interaction dynamics involving a Passenger, the Ride-Sharing App, a Driver, and the GPS Service. It initiates with the Passenger activating real-time tracking in the app, triggering a sequence where the app requests real-time tracking from the Driver. Subsequently, the Driver seeks location data from the GPS Service, which is then relayed back to the Passenger through the app. Continuously updating the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), the EcoRide App ensures the Passenger remains informed about the Driver's location until the completion of the journey. The iterative process, marked by the condition 'until Driver Reaches Destination Location,' underscores the repetitive nature of these actions throughout the ride

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Deployment View

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Content**

</div>

The deployment view describes:

1.  technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with
    infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments,
    computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other
    infrastructure elements and

2.  mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure
    elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development
environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you
should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as
distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or
container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors
and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those
elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of
your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and
describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Software does not run without hardware. This underlying infrastructure
can and will influence a system and/or some cross-cutting concepts.
Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section
3.2. as technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box.
In this section one can zoom into this black box using additional
deployment diagrams:

-   UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it,
    probably with nested diagrams, when your infrastructure is more
    complex.

-   When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams
    rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able
    to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

See [Deployment View](https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/) in the arc42
documentation.

## Infrastructure Level 1

Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

-   distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments,
    computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between
    them

-   important justifications or motivations for this deployment
    structure

-   quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure

-   mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and
adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

# Cross-cutting Concepts

<div class="formalpara-title">

These cross-cutting concepts play a pivotal role in establishing and maintaining conceptual integrity, contributing to the consistency and homogeneity of our architecture and underpinning the inner qualities of our system

### *User Experience (UX)*

User Experience, often abbreviated as UX, focuses on creating a positive and seamless interaction between users and a digital product or service.

It encompasses various aspects, including the consistency of design and functionality, the representation of branding elements and logos, app navigation that ensures easy and intuitive user journeys, user authentication processes, push notifications for timely updates, geolocation and maps for location-based services, the flow for booking rides, payment processing, offline functionality to maintain usability without an internet connection, and a 5-star rating system with optional comments to gather user feedback. 

Additionally, it includes the recognition of driver achievements through medals, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Architecture and Design Patterns

The architecture and design of a digital application involve key decisions regarding the underlying technology and structure. 

This includes the use of a NoSQL database for flexible data storage, a Google Cloud-based infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability, integration with Google Maps for location-related features. 

In addition payment gateways like PayPal and Klarna for secure and convenient transactions, the implementation of reusable components such as buttons, cards, and navigation bars for a consistent look and feel, and adherence to design guidelines like Material Design for Android and Human Interface Guidelines for iOS to provide a user-friendly and familiar interface.

### Safety and Security Concepts

Ensuring the safety and security of users' data and the application itself is paramount. 

This involves implementing data encryption techniques to protect sensitive information, establishing a robust data backup and recovery system to prevent data loss, complying with data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (DSVGO), creating an incident response plan to address security breaches and other emergencies effectively, and employing secure user authentication methods to prevent unauthorized access and maintain user privacy.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Architecture Decisions

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Contents**

</div>

Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions
including rationales. With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative
based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision
should be documented here in this central section or whether you better
document it locally (e.g. within the white box template of one building
block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the
most important decisions of your architecture.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace
your decisions.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

Various options:

-   ADR ([Documenting Architecture
    Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions))
    for every important decision

-   List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:

-   more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

See [Architecture Decisions](https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/) in the
arc42 documentation. There you will find links and examples about ADR.

# Quality Requirements

<div class="formalpara-title">

This section elaborates on the established quality goals of **Reliability**, 
**User-Friendliness**, and **Data Security**. <br>
The Quality Tree provides a detailed quality tree along with associated scenarios, encompassing both high-priority requirements essential for core objectives and additional quality measures with lower priority.

Each requirement is carefully tailored to address the specific and quantifiable expectations of stakeholders, providing a robust foundation for informed development and rigorous evaluation of our ride-sharing solution.

| Quality Requirements |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| Reliability |  |  |
| User-Friendliness |  |  |
| Data Security |  |  |


## Quality Tree

Our Quality Tree consists of the values reliability, user-friendliness, and data security. The leaves are: Real-time Transaction Latency, Accurate ETA and Tracking, Intuitive App Interface, Efficient Customer Support, Secure Payment Processor, and Privacy Protection. 

![QualityTree](images/QualityTree.png)


## Quality Scenarios

**Reliability**

Real-time Transaction Latency
A user initiates a ride booking transaction. Under normal operations the system maintains an average latency of two seconds or better for processing all ride booking transactions, consistently falling within the acceptable range of 1.5 to 2.5 seconds

Accurate ETA and Tracking
A user wants an accurate and reliable estimated time of arrival (ETA) and real-time tracking of drivers at runtime. 
The system consistently provides this information and checks the provided information with ride completion times, passenger feedback and tracking data, to confirm that the displayed ETAs align with actual arrival times

**User-friendliness**

Intuitive App Interface
A user wants to switch seamlessly between devices, sign in or register quickly and wants to request rides without manually entering their location.
The system provides a uniform, intuitive interface with a hamburger icon for additional settings. It requires only email and password for login and registration and auto-tracks the user's location for ride requests in a few seconds.

Efficient Customer Support
A user encounters an application error during the live-phase and seeks assistance. 
The system provides swift and efficient customer support which takes a maximum of 10 minutes, additionally the system includes a FAQ and live chat support, and automatically opens a new ticket for each issue.

**Data Security**

Privacy Compliance
The developer wants to adapt the system after data protection regulations have been breached or new laws have been passed. The system is updated to solve security measurements and undergoes weekly reviews to implement preventive measures. 


Secure Payment Processing
A user who conducts a payment transaction wants secure handling of the payment data. 
The system confirms secure processing of user payment data through robust encryption, weekly security audits and penetration testing

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

A table with columns \<Term> and \<Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
